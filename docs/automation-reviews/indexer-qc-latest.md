# UPSTREAM-QA Solana Indexer QC/QA

- Run: `2026-08-26T17:36:30+07:00`
- Scope: `C:\Tuan\devApps\solana_indexer`
- Revision: `879c420ebc8434ae6897ed956ef30445b2faa9d3`
- Compared with QA baseline: `e048067` (1 commit, 5 changed files)
- Compared with `origin/main`: 1 ahead, 0 behind
- Latest DEV handoff: `UPSTREAM-CLI-ENTRYPOINT-006`
- Overall result: the reviewed replay/readiness shared-helper change passes, but independent alias execution finds thirty other CLI entrypoints still silently no-op. `UPSTREAM-QA-CLI-ENTRYPOINT-004` is a new HIGH-severity failure; live qualification also remains blocked by absent fresh canonical evidence.

## Reviewed DEV delta (1/20)

| Item | Status | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `UPSTREAM-CLI-ENTRYPOINT-006` | `PASS` | Commit `879c420` extracts the canonical real-path helper and applies it to both operational readiness and replay/load. A real Windows junction test makes aliased replay emit its schema-v1 result at 7,495.76 blocks/s and aliased readiness emit schema v2 with blocked exit 1; direct/import identity regression and the complete suite pass. |

- Available DEV delta: exactly 1 distinct fix after `e048067`; the complete delta was exhausted.
- Verification result: 1 PASS, 0 FAIL, 0 BLOCKED, 0 SKIP.
- Exact fix/enhancement shortfall: 19 because no other distinct DEV outcome exists after the prior QA commit. No evidence was duplicated or split to manufacture the count.

## Independent 23-domain reconciliation

| Domain | Status | Concrete evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Path-parameter boundary | `PASS` | The committed focused regression passes empty and populated transaction state, a 32/32 malformed/delimiter matrix across all 16 consumers, valid transaction preservation, zero diagnostics, and zero `http_internal_error` metrics. |
| Token/account/supply authority | `PASS` | Full suite passes indexed token balance, Token-2022 funding, complete finalized account snapshot, token-account projection, and token-supply contracts. |
| Holder and whale concentration | `PASS` | `indexed token holders aggregate owners with versioned canonical evidence` and authoritative-exclusion concentration tests pass. |
| Trader and wallet analytics | `PASS` | Exact wallet cost basis/PnL, funding, funding-cluster, profile, and partial-coverage tests pass. |
| Pool identity and quote evidence | `PASS` | Finalized Raydium, Orca, Meteora, Pump/PumpSwap, Phoenix, and OpenBook snapshot/quote tests pass with exact venue dependencies. |
| Price and depeg reference | `PASS` | Independent USDC reference, Pyth evidence, expiry, depeg bound, and nominal USD path tests pass. |
| Liquidity and risk | `PASS` | Exact pool reserve/depth evidence and mature two-way finalized bot-readiness/risk gates pass. |
| Volume and candles | `PASS` | Exact rolling USD volume and direction-stable integer OHLCV tests pass without floating point. |
| Provenance, freshness, and finality | `PASS` | Malformed provenance, wrong-network, stale/future evidence, finality promotion, and finalized downgrade tests all fail closed as designed. |
| REST schemas and pagination | `PASS` | Stable cursor scope/digest, filtering, explicit projections, invalid-cursor rejection, and compact catalogs pass; the path defect is tracked separately. |
| Read-only JSON-RPC | `PASS` | Indexed method allowlist, parameter bounds, cursor isolation, malformed/oversized envelope, and invalid-evidence tests pass. |
| WebSocket contracts and replay | `PASS` | Ordered persisted replay, resume, snapshot isolation, corruption rejection, acknowledgement, timeout, capacity, and backpressure tests pass. |
| Numeric precision | `PASS` | Raw integer fields use exact string/UInt64/UInt256 or numerator/denominator contracts; Token-2022 epoch fee and Q64/lot/bin math tests pass. |
| Replay, reorg, and idempotency | `PASS` | 1,000-block replay preserves canonical counts, duplicate idempotency, replacement correction, heap, and throughput invariants. |
| Retry, failover, and `Retry-After` | `PASS` | Local/external provider rotation, half-open probes, wrong-network rejection, bounded 1,000-3,600,000 ms retry hints, and credential-safe failover tests pass. |
| Gap, backfill, and recovery logic | `PASS` | Atomic bounded gap repair, produced-slot refusal, immutable non-promoting backfill, and detached recovery-evidence rejection tests pass. |
| Persistence and atomic recovery | `PASS` | Durable concurrent writes/appends, snapshot batch validation-before-mutation, fingerprint replacement, quarantine, and exact checkpoint tests pass. |
| Warehouse and schema compatibility | `PASS` | Ordered retry-safe dual-sink checkpointing, canonical event/content hashes, PostgreSQL projection preimages, Redis hot-state bounds, and ClickHouse UInt256 raw amounts pass repository tests. |
| Fail-closed redaction | `PASS` | Explicit public projection allowlists, dead-letter/diagnostic credential redaction, bounded operational JSON, malformed evidence, and secret-file tests pass. |
| Operational readiness diagnostics | `PASS` | The schema-v2 report contains all twenty ordered redacted dimensions; local provider validation rejects missing, public, cardinality-mismatched, canonically duplicate, credential-bearing, path-bearing, query-bearing, and fragment-bearing topologies while accepting a distinct loopback pair set. Canonical real-path entrypoint comparison preserves CLI execution through workspace aliases. |
| CLI entrypoint execution | `FAIL` | Only readiness and replay/load use the shared real-path helper. Thirty other direct CLI modules retain lexical path equality. Through a real workspace junction, `exporter-health` exits 0 with zero output while the canonical invocation emits evidence and exits 1. |
| Bounded performance | `PASS` | Full suite passes 348/348; syntax passes 85/85; replay completes at 6,510.53 blocks/s with 9,374,248-byte heap growth below 536,870,912 bytes. |
| Live operational qualification | `BLOCKED` | Provider variables and active exporter/warehouse/backup/recovery status files are absent; both retained indexes report `wrong_network`; retained finalized exporter evidence is 406,432 slots behind and 370,473,529 ms old at the trigger time. |

The contract minimum is satisfied with 23 distinct evidence domains: 21 PASS, 1 FAIL, and 1 BLOCKED. These domains use separate contracts or failure boundaries and are not cosmetic splits.

## UPSTREAM-QA-PATH-PARAMETER-003

- Severity: `PASS`
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: run `test/indexer.test.js` test `resource routes reject malformed or delimiter-decoding path parameters`; it exercises malformed escapes and decoded delimiters for preparation, quote, evidence, token, wallet, price, volume, transaction, account, mint, holder, token-account, pool, candle, and risk consumers, with empty/populated transaction state and a valid transaction control.
- Evidence: the committed test passes 32/32 consumer-matrix checks, retains 4/4 empty-state token-account/transaction checks and 2/2 populated transaction checks, preserves `signature-1` with HTTP 200, captures zero diagnostics, and observes `terminal_dex_internal_failures_total{operation="http_internal_error"} 0`.
- Affected contracts: shared REST/internal path-parameter validation, regression coverage for 16 resource consumers, internal failure metrics, diagnostic callback behavior, and client retry/error classification.
- Expected behavior: the source correction and committed regression together cover empty/populated transaction state, all 16 malformed/delimiter consumer boundaries, valid-route preservation, and unchanged internal-failure telemetry.
- Actual behavior: the committed regression now matches the expected controlled HTTP 400 and telemetry contracts across the complete scoped matrix.
- Acceptance criteria: committed table-driven 16-consumer malformed/delimiter matrix; retained empty and populated transaction checks; preserved valid transaction route; zero internal-failure counter and diagnostic callbacks. All criteria are met.
- Validation results: focused committed regression 1/1 PASS; malformed/delimiter matrix 32/32 PASS plus retained empty/populated transaction checks; valid transaction preservation PASS; diagnostics 0 PASS; internal-failure metric 0 PASS; full suite 348/348 PASS; syntax 84/84 PASS; replay invariants PASS at 7,547.45 blocks/s and 8,902,232-byte heap growth.
- Compatibility impact: source behavior is compatible for valid paths and deterministically rejects malformed paths; the regression enhancement changes no runtime or consumer contract.
- Performance impact: validation remains bounded to 256 decoded characters before lookup; no replay/heap/throughput regression was observed.
- Blockers: none; the prior regression gap is closed.

## UPSTREAM-QA-HEALTH-001

- Severity: `PASS`
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: run the health projection regression and the full suite.
- Evidence: injected unknown store and diagnostic fields remain excluded from REST `GET /api/health`, JSON-RPC `getIndexerHealth`, and `GET /internal/feed/health`; established status/quality fields remain compatible.
- Affected contracts: REST, JSON-RPC, internal feed health, nested structure/chain/quality projections, and diagnostic redaction.
- Expected versus actual: explicit allowlists omit unknown fields and unhealthy state fails closed; actual behavior matches.
- Acceptance criteria: explicit projection allowlists at every health endpoint, stable documented fields/status, and green regression/replay checks.
- Validation results: full suite 348/348, syntax 84/84, and all replay invariants PASS.
- Compatibility/performance impact: additive hardening only; no established field removal or bounded-performance regression observed.
- Blockers: none.

## UPSTREAM-QA-TOKEN-PROJECTION-002

- Severity: `PASS`
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: run the token balance/holder divergence regressions; independently corrupt an unrelated pool, then the requested mint projection, while querying holder and token-account REST routes.
- Evidence: unrelated pool corruption does not block valid mint-scoped responses; relevant mint divergence returns `indexed_holder_evidence_unavailable` and `indexed_token_account_evidence_unavailable`. Full token/account/holder regressions remain green.
- Affected contracts: REST holder/token-account projections, mint-scoped balance/snapshot evidence, explicit fields, and failure envelopes.
- Expected versus actual: unrelated aggregate evidence is isolated while relevant corruption fails closed; actual behavior matches.
- Acceptance criteria: mint-scoped isolation, stable explicit 503 reasons, unchanged successful shapes, and no unknown-field disclosure.
- Validation results: full suite 348/348, syntax 84/84, and all replay invariants PASS.
- Compatibility/performance impact: successful payloads remain unchanged and checks remain mint-scoped.
- Blockers: none.

## UPSTREAM-QA-OPS-PROVIDER-002

- Severity: `PASS` (resolved by `a5d60f6`, hardened by `7e78632` and `e8fb4c7`)
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: call `assessProviderConfiguration` with canonically equivalent loopback identities such as `http://LOCALHOST:80` and `http://localhost/`; directly validate RPC and WebSocket URLs containing userinfo, a non-root path, a query, or a fragment.
- Evidence: canonically equivalent RPC or WebSocket identities return `{ available: true, healthy: false, reason: "provider_configuration_invalid", mode: null }`. All eight independent authority cases throw the redacted `credential-free root URL` error, while a distinct IPv4/IPv6 two-pair topology returns healthy local-validator mode. Three focused committed regressions pass.
- Affected contracts: `npm run health:operational`, `upstream_operational_readiness` schema v2 `provider` check, aggregate `ready`, local polling/streaming qualification, operator incident response, and any QC/automation gate consuming the report.
- Expected behavior: local provider readiness is healthy only when RPC and WebSocket endpoint sets contain unique canonical credential-free loopback root URLs, remain within supported bounds, and are cardinality-compatible.
- Actual behavior: raw and canonical duplicate identities plus credential/path/query/fragment-bearing endpoints fail closed consistently with runtime constructors; valid distinct endpoint sets and external provider behavior remain available.
- Acceptance criteria: reject raw and canonical duplicate effective RPC/WebSocket endpoint sets; reject userinfo, non-root paths, queries, and fragments with a stable redacted reason; preserve root loopback, missing/public/mismatched/valid topology, external Helius/Alchemy, and secret-redaction behavior. All criteria are met.
- Validation results: independent canonical-duplicate, eight-case authority, and valid IPv4/IPv6 controls PASS; focused committed provider regressions 3/3 PASS; full suite 348/348 PASS; syntax 84/84 PASS; replay invariants PASS at 7,547.45 blocks/s with 8,902,232-byte heap growth.
- Compatibility impact: false-positive local `provider.healthy=true` results now fail closed; operators using credentials or non-root URL components must move those values out of local validator URLs. No REST/RPC/WebSocket payload changed.
- Performance impact: bounded parsing of at most four configured RPC and WebSocket endpoints; negligible relative to state/evidence loading.
- Blockers: none; the finding is closed.

## UPSTREAM-QA-CLI-ENTRYPOINT-003

- Severity: `PASS` (resolved by `a6eb293`)
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: invoke `src/operational-readiness.js` through a workspace alias whose lexical path differs from the module file path but resolves to the same file; the prior lexical comparison could skip `main()` and return a silent success.
- Evidence: `isInvokedFile` now compares canonical real paths and falls back to deterministic resolved lexical paths only when file resolution fails. The injected same-file alias control returns true, a different-file control and empty invocation return false, and direct health smoke emits schema v2 with nine redacted blockers and exit 1.
- Affected contracts: scheduled `health:operational` execution, sandbox/workspace aliases, user-visible automation evidence, process exit status, and fail-closed readiness reporting.
- Expected behavior: every direct invocation of the readiness module executes `main()`, emits one bounded schema-v2 report, and exits nonzero when readiness is blocked, independent of equivalent workspace aliases.
- Actual behavior: canonical file identity selects direct invocation correctly while imported-module behavior and deterministic failure fallback remain unchanged.
- Acceptance criteria: compare file identity through canonical real paths; retain a deterministic non-throwing fallback; cover alias, different-file, and empty-invocation cases; demonstrate emitted fail-closed health evidence and nonzero blocked exit. All criteria are met.
- Validation results: focused readiness/provider regressions 3/3 PASS; direct health smoke emits twenty ordered checks, nine blockers, and exit 1; full suite 348/348 PASS; syntax 84/84 PASS; replay invariants PASS at 7,547.45 blocks/s with 8,902,232-byte heap growth; HEAD remained `a6eb293` and the DEV lock remained absent throughout the stable validation pass.
- Compatibility impact: no schema, configuration, REST, RPC, or WebSocket contract changed; direct aliased invocations that previously returned no evidence now correctly execute and can return blocked status.
- Performance impact: one bounded pair of filesystem real-path resolutions at CLI startup only; no replay/heap/throughput regression observed.
- Blockers: none; the finding is closed.

## UPSTREAM-QA-CLI-ENTRYPOINT-004

- Severity: `FAIL` / `HIGH`
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: create a filesystem junction to the repository and invoke `src/exporter-health.js` through that alias. Compare it with canonical-path invocation, then enumerate direct CLI guards that still compare `fileURLToPath(import.meta.url)` and `process.argv[1]` lexically.
- Evidence: the aliased exporter-health invocation exits 0 with zero output; canonical invocation emits a 216-character fail-closed health result and exits 1. Source enumeration finds exactly 30 legacy direct-entrypoint files, including exporter/stream health, backup/recovery/backfill, warehouse/commercial/operational workers, retention/archive/reconciliation, provider exporters, oracle/snapshot producers, and reduced/Geyser preflights. Only readiness and replay/load currently consume `isInvokedFile`.
- Affected contracts: scheduled job execution, health and qualification evidence, backup/recovery safety gates, ingestion/exporter activation, warehouse convergence, retention/reconciliation, all snapshot producers, automation exit status, and visible per-run reporting under workspace aliases.
- Expected behavior: every supported direct CLI executes exactly once through canonical or aliased workspace paths, imported modules remain side-effect free, and blocked commands emit their documented evidence with a nonzero exit.
- Actual behavior: the two migrated CLIs behave correctly, but thirty remaining CLIs can silently skip `main()` and falsely exit 0 when Node resolves the module through a junction or sandbox alias.
- Acceptance criteria: migrate all 30 enumerated legacy direct-entrypoint guards to the shared helper; add a table-driven inventory regression proving no legacy lexical guard remains; exercise representative health, recovery/preflight, worker/sync, exporter/stream, retention/reconciliation, and snapshot commands through a real or injected alias; preserve direct and import behavior, output schemas, redaction, and blocked exit codes.
- Validation results: real junction replay PASS with schema v1; real junction readiness PASS with schema v2 and exit 1; real junction exporter-health FAIL with empty output and exit 0 versus direct evidence and exit 1; focused readiness 1/1 PASS; full suite 348/348 PASS; syntax 85/85 PASS; direct replay PASS at 6,510.53 blocks/s with 9,374,248-byte heap growth; stable HEAD `879c420` and no DEV lock before or after validation.
- Compatibility impact: fixing the remaining guards changes only incorrectly silent aliased direct invocations; canonical direct invocation, imported-module behavior, command arguments, output schemas, and consumers must remain stable.
- Performance impact: at most one bounded real-path comparison at each CLI startup; no steady-state ingestion, API, persistence, or replay cost is expected.
- Blockers: none; the repository already contains the shared helper and a working two-command migration pattern.

## UPSTREAM-QA-OPS-001

- Severity: `BLOCKED`
- Owner: `DEV`
- Reproduction: run `npm run health:operational`; load `data/index.json` and `data/mainnet-index.json` through `IndexStore.health(120000)`; assess retained `data/external-exporter-status.json` with the repository exporter-health contract.
- Evidence: the schema-v2 operational smoke exits 1 with nine ordered blockers: provider, index events, transactions, instructions, freshness, exporter, warehouse, backup, and recovery. RPC/WebSocket provider variables and default active exporter, warehouse checkpoint/failure, backup, and recovery files are absent. Both retained indexes fail closed with `status=wrong_network`, `healthy=false`, and `reason=indexed_block_mainnet_identity_missing_or_invalid`. Retained external evidence is finalized with zero recorded failures but fails `exporter_lagging` at 406,432 slots behind, a 512-slot maximum, and 366,917,519 ms age at the trigger time.
- Affected contracts: current ingestion freshness/finality, failover, warehouse convergence, backup/recovery readiness, public health, bot readiness, and live token/holder/whale/trader/pool/price/liquidity/volume qualification.
- Expected behavior: redacted fresh canonical-mainnet provider, exporter, exact warehouse convergence, backup, and recovery evidence are available; any missing, stale, lagged, malformed, or wrong-network input fails closed.
- Actual behavior: current live qualification cannot run; retained evidence correctly fails closed and was not treated as authoritative current mainnet data.
- Acceptance criteria: provide a redacted current canonical-mainnet operational evidence bundle with exact warehouse and fresh backup/recovery qualification while retaining every fail-closed boundary.
- Validation results: repository retry/failover, operational evidence, recovery, redaction, full regression, and replay checks pass; no provider, database, or production mutation was attempted.
- Compatibility/performance impact: no contract regression observed; sustained live ingestion and sink performance remain unqualified.
- Blockers: no configured provider endpoints or fresh active exporter/warehouse/backup/recovery evidence.

- NEXT_DEV_ACTION: migrate all 30 legacy direct CLI entrypoint guards to `isInvokedFile` and add an inventory plus representative alias-execution regression that proves blocked commands cannot silently exit 0.
